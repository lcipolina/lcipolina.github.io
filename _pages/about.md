I am a Research Scientist at [META’s FAIR lab](https://ai.meta.com/research/), where I work on large language model (LLM) agents for scientific discovery. My research focuses on developing novel techniques for the self-improvement of LLM agents and their application to coding and reasoning. I develop frameworks combining reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and game theory to study emergent behaviors in post-trained LLMs, with a focus on designing systematic evaluation protocols that assess their strategic reasoning, planning, and behavioral stability.


My professional background includes roles as a Student Researcher at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/), where I developed novel techniques for multi-agent decision processes, and as a Research Intern at [Juelich Supercomputing Center](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc), focusing on high-performance computing, large-scale generative models and LLM evaluation. I have also interned at [JPMorgan AI Research](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence) optimizing reinforcement learning algorithms for trading, and at [Microsoft AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/bing-speech-and-language-sciences/), working on model-based offline reinforcement learning for Bing’s search and revenue management. Earlier in my career, I worked as a front office quant at Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and HSBC in NY, implementing machine learning and diffusion models in C++.


My education includes an MSc in Mathematics from the [Courant Institute](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) at the New York University, where I specialized in stochastic differential equations and a PhD in Electrical Engineering at the University of Bristol.

I am also involved in a side project exploring [AI-based art restoration](https://artrestoreai.github.io/), where I investigate how machine learning can help preserve and restore cultural heritage.
