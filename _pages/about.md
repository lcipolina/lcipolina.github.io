I am a researcher on Artificial Intelligence with a particular focus on Mathematics. My research combines Game Theory and Reinforcement Learning. I have a side project on  [AI for art restoration](https://twitter.com/artrestoreai).

<!--  You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

 Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), # like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. --->
