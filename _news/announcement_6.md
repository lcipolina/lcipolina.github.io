I have started an internship at the [Tate Britain](https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-britain), where I applied diffusion models to a virtual restoration of the museum's pieces. The work was part of the Tate's collection [first rehang in over ten years] (https://www.tate.org.uk/press/press-releases/tate-britain-unveils-complete-rehang-of-the-worlds-greatest-collection-of-british-art).
